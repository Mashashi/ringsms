# Description

RingSMS allows you to send messages for free. Even if you are disconnected from the internet. It does so by calling the number to you wish to send a message in a pattern that can be recognized as usefull information (your written tesxt). It uses a advanced algorithm to identify unequivocally which character is being transmitted by calling the targeted number of the message the minimum possible times. It also employs a feature of error detection to make sure most of the times, the message you want to send is what reaches the other end. This feature can be turn on or off as it implies the transmission of extra information.
In order for the message to be correctly interpreted the user which you contact must have this same program installed on his or her phone. And the end user most not answer the call.

The logical question would be... "How do I know when I receive a regular call and a message?". RingSMS is solves this problem with the following approach at the first tone that it receives from the call that is incoming, if it takes to long, the application assumes that it can not be a message and displays a notification saying that is alright to pick up the phone call.

You can also share a list of strings with friends which have predefined identification making it possible to send useful information in a few time. This feature is called code map using. Within the application.

If you are looking for the source it might be useful to know that for now the application RingSMS, is copyright and code closed for now.
